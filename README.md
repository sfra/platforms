This is a simple demo of animations using canvas and socket.io libs. Copy socket.io.js file into
libs directory (instructions contained in libs/README.txt).

Then run
```bash
node server/server.js
```
from console and open index.html in two different browsers.
Use arrow keys to move your square, hold shift for turbo move, space for jump and
z for shot. Red square represents your "opponent".
